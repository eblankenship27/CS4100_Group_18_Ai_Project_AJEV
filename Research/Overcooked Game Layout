Overcooked

Example game play: https://youtu.be/BU9MHEOmH1k?si=0NVvVbZXQtrlVlcc

Goal of the Game:
  Fulfil as many orders as possible within the time constraints

  Mini goal:
    Move in the most optimal path to collect/place/serve ingredients

Aspects of the Game:
  - Grab orders
  - Prepare ingredients (chop, mix, etc)
  - Combine ingredients
  - Send out orders
  - Avoid obstacles
  - Work with partner chief (?)
  - Wait for ingredients to cook
  - Depending on level
    - Wash dishes
    - Throw food
    - Go through portals
    - Avoid ledges

States:
  - In play
      Based on where the agent is
      Based on how far along a current order is
  - Game end

State definitions:
  Fully v/s Partially Observable - Partially Observable
    * Partially because it is unaware of the next orders that will come through
  Single-Agent v/s Multi-Agent - Single-Agent
  Deterministic v/s Non-Deterministic - Non-Deterministic
  Episodic v/s Sequential - Sequential
  Static v/s Dynamic - Dynamic
  Discrete v/s Continuous - Continuous
  Known v/s Unknown - Known

Controls:
  Move
    Forward
    Backwards
    Left
    Right
  Turn
    Right
    Left
  Chop/Prepare
  Pick up
  Set down

Necessary Perceivers:
  The orders
  The timer left
  Map of the level
    Where each ingredient is
    Where the serving portal is
  Tables/obstacles to avoid
  Type of food/ingredients
  Plates location

Potential Strategies:
  1. Fulfil orders in order of when they came in
  2. Fulfil orders in order of how much time they have left in the timer
  3. Fulfil orders that have the fewest steps first
  4. Work on multiple orders at once, doing multiple of the same ingredients in a row

	Sub-strategies:
    Once the timer has less than x seconds left, move strategy to 3 to save time
